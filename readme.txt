The definitive solution for scheduled posts with a missed schedule warning. Thanks to a Cron that runs every minute, scheduled posts with missed deadlines will be published automatically. The plugin can run without affecting your site performance and is programmed to do so.

== Description ==

After installing the Scheduled Posts Issue Fixer plugin, you add a WP Cron that automatically publishes your posts, Custom Post Types, and posts that you receive a "Schedule Missed" warning without any settings.

When you disable the plugin, this scheduled task will be automatically removed from your site.

Note : Scheduled Posts Issue Fixer plugin never creates performance problems and ensures that your posts that give a missed schedule error are published intermittently by obtaining 20 of them from the database.
