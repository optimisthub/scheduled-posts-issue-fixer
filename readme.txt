This plugin does one thing and does it well: it fixes the missed schedule error and triggers your scheduled posts to publish on time. We’ve developed this post scheduler plugin with performance in mind, so it won’t affect the speed or performance of your website.

== Description ==

Every minutes this post scheduler plugin checks for posts that have the missed schedule error, and will automatically publish them for you.

Multiple techniques for checking your site’s missed posts are used to make sure a scheduled post is not missed.
 
== Installation ==

* Upload `scheduled-posts-issue-fixer` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
* Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
